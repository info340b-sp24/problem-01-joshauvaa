    <p>Sokka is one of the main characters in the animated Nickelodeon series 
        <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></cite>. 
        He hails from the Southern Watertribe and has a reputation for being sarcastic, funny, and skilled with weapons 
        including the sword and the boomerang. Sokka played a key role in Team Avatar who helped put an end to the 100 
        year war. He has a younger sister named Katara and had multiple love interests throughout the series including 
        Yue and Suki. A few reasons I admire Sokka include: 
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> He took on the heavy responsibility of looking after his tribe at the age of 16 after all the
            the men went off to fight in the war.
        </li>
        <li class="colored"> Despite being the only one in Team Avatar incapable of bending an element, he made a notable impact on their
            mission via his intellect and combat skills.
        </li>
        <li>
            He was versatile, finding an almost perfect balance between stern leadership and comic relief.
        </li>
    </ul>
